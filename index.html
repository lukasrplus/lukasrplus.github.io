  <div class="panel-body">
    I am from Vienna, Austria and currently enrolled in the inaugural class of Starter School in Chicago. After my studies in International Business and Economics, I started working for an Austrian TelCo operator as Brand Manager.<br>

    My passion for tech lead my path to an Austrian Startup and finally to a Hacker School where I currently learn to code for myself. Please be patient with me and my code since I am a bloody beginner.<br>

    Besides tech I love Golf, Tennis, Skiing and Cooking.
